                        &emsp; hi, good morning, afternoon, evening, or night. how are you? are you well? i would be very happy to hear good news from you. i want to thank you for everything you have given me, everything you have fought for, and everything you have sacrificed. i am very, very grateful to have met you. at that day, i just wanted to find a friend to fill my lonely time, but i met someone who god may have sent especially for me, and that person is you. i still remember the early days when we got close. that night changed my life. i felt that there was still someone who cared about me, who was still willing to be with me when i was lonely, with nowhere to talk, no one ask me to go to home. but you came when i needed all of that. you came when i wanted all of that. changing someone's life isn't easy, but your presence, your smile, your warmth, your laughter made me realize that i was falling in love with someone. in fact you're successful to change my life.

                    <span>
                        &emsp;  i love you so much, my dear. i want the whole world, the entire universe, to know that i truly love you. i'm sorry for always being imperfect, for always making mistakes in my actions and decisions. i always learn from my mistakes. it's all thanks to you that i've come to understand how to care for someone's feelings, the little things you want, the things you always ask for things that sometimes make me anxious and embarrassed, like saying “sorry,” “thank you,” and even “i love you.” i've come to realize that a person's words can sometimes change how others think and even change their personality.

thank you for still being with me, for still accompanying me in both good times and bad. i promise myself that i will protect you and love you for the rest of my life.

happy birthday, chatrine. my beloved. may this year bring you even more happiness, beauty, joy, and maturity.
